refactor(web-ui): improve performance with optimistic UI updates

Implements optimistic UI updates to make the application feel instantaneous when creating, updating, or deleting links.

- Removes the slow, blocking `fetchFromKVAndCache` call from the server's CUD operations, making the API responses much faster.
- Modifies the frontend to update the local state immediately, providing a responsive user experience.
- Adds error handling to revert the UI state if a background API call fails, ensuring data consistency.
